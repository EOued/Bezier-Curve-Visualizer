# CPP Bezier Curve Visualizer

This project was made by Elio OUEDRAOGO, aiming to visualize Cubic Bezier curve in order to stroke paths between two points.\
As it was a small project, there probably won't be any modifications in the future. This repository only serve as a showcase of the code.\

## Usage of the code

The first step is to make all cpp files using the command `make`.\
Then, the execution of the `visualizer` executable will pop a SFML window with 4 dots. Two represent the start and end point, and two others represent the tangents.\\
To leave the renderer, simply press `<Ctrl-C>`.\
